# Junior High School Student C++ Tutor File

## üì¶ Getting Started with Git

### üß≠ Clone the Homework Repository (First Time)
To download the homework files for the first time, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DennisLee03/4cppTutor.git
cd 4cppTutor
```

### üîÑ Update to the Latest Version (Pull Changes)
If the instructor pushes updated files or fixes, run the following inside the cloned folder:
```bash
git pull
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- **Do not rename or move original files** like `validate.sh`, `test.sh`, etc., or the validation script may not work.
- If you want to experiment or back up your version, copy the file:
  ```bash
  cp q1.cpp my_q1.cpp
  ```

- If you encounter line-ending issues (e.g., `^M` or `bad interpreter`), run:
  ```bash
  dos2unix *.sh
  ```
