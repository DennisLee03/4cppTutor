# Homework 1
## Question 1 - Hello World!
* **input**: a name, which is a `string`
    * a data type to store a sequence of characters, 
    * such as "Dennis", "Nathan", they are surrounded by double quatations
    * you should use `string` to store the name you type, and you need to do `#include<string>` beforehand.
* **output**: Hello <someone's name>!
* **examples**:
    ``bash
    $ ./q1
    Dennis
    Hello Dennis!
    ````
* **caution**: NO white spaces in the input name

## Question 2 - Temperature Transformations
* Definitions:
    1. The kelvin (symbol: K) is the base unit for temperature in the International System of Units (SI). The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale that starts at the lowest possible temperature (absolute zero), taken to be 0 K. By definition, the Celsius scale (symbol °C) and the Kelvin scale have the exact same magnitude; that is, a rise of 1 K is equal to a rise of 1 °C and vice versa, and any temperature in degrees Celsius can be converted to kelvin by adding 273.15. ** In a nutshell, °C = K + 273.15**
    2. The Fahrenheit scale  is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736). It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F). **°F = 1.8x°C + 32**
* **input**: a `float` number which indicates the magnitude of the temperature based on °C.
* **output**: includes two lines "Fahrenheit: <ans1>" and "Kelvin: <ans2>"
    * you need to change to a new line to print the 2nd answer.
* **examples**:
    ```bash
    $ ./q2
    25
    Fahrenheit: 77
    Kelvin: -248.15 
    ```
* **caution**:
